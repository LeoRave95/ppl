- Homeworks:
    - expandable condition in repeat until
    - errors in macros

## 03/11/2017 Haskell 1

## 17/11/2017 Haskell 2
- Exams of 05/07/2017 and 20/07/2017
    -- more on types: Trees
    -- map over trees

## 05/12/2017 Haskell 3
- State
    + as Functor
    + as Applicative Functor
    + as Monad
    + included example from \[[1](http://cmsc-16100.cs.uchicago.edu/2016/Lectures/18-state-monad-1.php)\]\[[2](http://cmsc-16100.cs.uchicago.edu/2016/Lectures/19-state-monad-2.php)\]

## 12/12/2017 Haskell 4
- State Monad 2
- Logger Monad
- **TODO** exercise on HTML

## 19/12/2017 Erlang 1
- Public Subscribe Code Read
- TCP PUB SUB
    -  Types: Lists, Tuples, atoms, primitives
    - List comprehension, pattern matching, 
    - conditionals: guards, if 
    
## 22/12/2017 Erlang 2
- PubSub Actors
- Exams July 2017 05th and 20th
    -  Higer order functions 2: foldL,foldR, filter
    - Actors and Concurrency: spawn, messages, links
- Updated TCP example with more stable and clean code (documentation will be added soon)

### Homeworks
- [Haskell] Play with the state monad. Can I realize a priority queue with it?
- [Erlang] extend the TCP example to have rest API also in the subscriber (Hint: all the code you need is in the publisher)
